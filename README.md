- User registers and verifies email via OTP.
- Selects quiz category and difficulty.
- One question is shown at a time with a 60-second timer.
- After quiz completion, the user:
    - Sees their total score
    - Reviews all their answers with correct answers highlighted
- Best scores are stored and shown in View Records, which can be filtered by category and difficulty.
